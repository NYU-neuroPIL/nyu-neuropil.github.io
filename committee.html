                                field. We seek to work with graduate students and faculty
                                to improve the neuroscience curriculum and increase
                                student representation in the decisions that define our

                                Institute (NI). While joining the programs is ultimately
                                beneficial, it has also led to some inconsistencies in
                                housing, classes, funding, etc. The Uptown/Downtown
                                Committee will work to alleviate these differences in
                                student life between CNS and NI. With input from the
                                student body, this committee will focus on promoting

# NYU neuroPIL

website for NYU neuroPIL

forked from: https://nicolas-van.github.io/bootstrap-4-github-pages/

To do:

1. Pick a theme and figure out how it works with our setup -- Jenn
2. Clean up stuff from forked repo -- Billy
3. add first pass at public pages (see below) -- Ionatan
4. try to set up homepage arrangement (see layout.pdf, example is
   [Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/) homepage) -- wait for 1+3
5. put together publications page, (see
   [example](https://www.dudmanlab.org/html/publications.html)) --
   Billy
   - put together Google form (or similar) asking for: title; one
     sentence summary; summary picture; tags for topics, techniques,
     labs; links (paper, bioRxiv, code/data, reprint)
   - work on something that renders Google form output to what we want
   - see if can automate submission of Google form to adding data to
     github repo

# NYU neuroPIL

website for NYU neuroPIL

To do:

1. [ ] put together publications page, (see
   [example](https://www.dudmanlab.org/html/publications.html)) --
   Billy
   - put together Google form (or similar) asking for: title; one
     sentence summary; summary picture; tags for topics, techniques,
     labs; links (paper, bioRxiv, code/data, reprint)
   - work on something that renders Google form output to what we want
   - see if can automate submission of Google form to adding data to
     github repo
4. [ ] Make contact form live -- Jenn
2. [ ] Embed Twitter feed -- waiting for twitter account
3. [ ] Fill in information
   - Executive council: coming soon
   - FAQ: Katie, Chloe, etc
   - resources -- Ionatan
4. [X] Change color palette -- Jenn
5. [ ] Get photo for background -- Ionatan
6. [ ] get logo -- Katie
8. [X] remove map at bottom
9. [X] try and break up into separate html files -- Billy -- Actually,
   this is probably fine as long as we document it and write up
   directions well, so probably ignore
7. [ ] add directions for editing and updating
